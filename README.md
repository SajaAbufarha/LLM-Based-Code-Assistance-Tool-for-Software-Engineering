# AI-Code-Optimization-and-Refactoring-Tool
In Software Engineering, code is the foundation upon which all software is built; its
quality directly impacts the software product's reliability, maintainability, and overall
success. Poorly written or unoptimized code can lead to software that is difficult to
maintain, prone to bugs, and inefficient in performance. This project aims to develop an
AI-driven tool designed for software engineers, to assist in the continuous improvement
and refactoring of code.

The project will focus on integrating the tool within the Software Development Life Cycle
(SDLC), making it a valuable asset during the development and maintenance phases.
This will be done by automating the code review process and providing insights, which
will reduce the time developers spend on manual code review, allowing them to focus on
more critical tasks. Additionally, it will serve as an educational resource for developers,
helping them understand and apply best practices in software engineering. To do this,
the tool will use Large Language Models (LLMs) and prompt engineering to analyze
code and provide feedback and recommendations for improvements. These
recommendations will include optimizations for performance, enhancements in code
readability, and adherence to best coding practices. The tool will also suggest refactoring
opportunities, such as identifying and eliminating code smells, reducing technical debt,
and improving the overall architecture of the software.

Finally, this project aims to contribute to the field of software engineering by delivering a
tool that enhances code quality, boosts productivity, and ensures that software systems
are both scalable and maintainable over time.
